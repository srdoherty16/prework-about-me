      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 28 years old and currently work as a payroll specialist. I live with my parents during the week, but on the weekends I'm either at my sisters or a friend's house. I'm always on the move doing something. I have two dogs, Cupcake and Freyja, who come with me everywhere. They are both types of doodles and both so sweet.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally born in Maryland, I moved to Massachusetts when I was young. However, my sister and I spent every summer visiting my grandfather in Maryland. I got to grow up in two states at once.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy singing, dancing, crocheting, and sewing. I also enjoy photography, letting someone see the world from your point of view.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Occupation, I'm still not sure. However my ideal job would be fully remote and I would have a little more freedom with my day.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in New Hampshire, just over the border of Massachusetts. I moved here with my family about 5 years ago.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>When I was younger, my dad has this computer game. Not only was it on a floppy disk, but you had to enter code into the computer just to play it. Every other sceen you were writing code to make your next move. I learned how to play this game before I could even type. Ever since then I've wanted to learn more about coding and how these awesome platforms that we use every day are created.</p>
